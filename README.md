# 🧬 RNA-seq Case Study

A practical demonstration of an RNA-seq workflow using public data.  
This project shows the steps of quality control, alignment, read counting, differential expression, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Overview
- **Goal:** Analyze RNA-seq data from two experimental groups (control vs treatment).  
- **Dataset:** Public dataset from GEO (to be specified, e.g. GSEXXXX).  
- **Outcome:** Identify differentially expressed genes and visualize them with volcano plots, heatmaps, and PCA.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Quality Control** – FastQC, MultiQC  
2. **Alignment** – STAR (to reference genome)  
3. **Counting** – featureCounts  
4. **Differential Expression** – DESeq2 in R  
5. **Visualization** – Volcano plot, heatmap, PCA plot
